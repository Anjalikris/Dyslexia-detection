Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder impacting reading proficiency, is
commonly diagnosed using traditional approaches like clinical evaluations and
standardized tests. The motivation behind this research is to develop an accurate and efficient method for early detection of dyslexia and further brain tumors,
which can significantly improve patient outcomes. The proposed method is a
novel approach for dyslexia detection, combining brain magnetic resonance imaging analysis with phonological game assessments. MRI scans were analyzed using
Voxel-Based Morphometry to identify structural differences between dyslexic and
non-dyslexic brains. Phonological games were designed to evaluate individual
phonological skills which is a main element in detection. The method demonstrate the large effectiveness in diagnosing dyslexia. Further validation in larger
populations is necessary, the initial findings are encouraging and suggests the
potential for early detection and intervention for dyslexia and brain tumors.
